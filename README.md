The following Python program takes target sounds of particular phonological processes and finds appropriate target words from a kindergarten appropriate corpus.
My hope is that it would make it easier for speech language pathologists to find target words. 

For a more detailed explanation, view my Final Presentaion slides.

please note - when copying the code into your interpreter, make sure that you correctly create klist as KindergartenWords.txt
